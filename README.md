# Underground

This is a coding exercise to create an electronic version of a board game centred around the London Underground in which players race to be the first to navigate the Tube to get to 4 locations.

This presents some nice challenges around simulating the line and station structure and allowing the user to move between stations and switch lines at the appropriate locations.

Once the game "engine" is written, there's the option of creating a frontend for it Unity, or maybe just javascript.
